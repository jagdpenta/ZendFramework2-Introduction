Zend Framework 2 - Introductory Application
=======================

Introduction
------------
This is a simple, application based on the ZendFramework2 Skeleton application. The aim is that it isn't too complex, yet complex enough to help work through the Introduction to Zend Framework 2 series on [Malt Blue](http://www.maltblue.com/articles-2/zend-framework-2-core-concepts-understanding-dependency-injection).
